            So what should I say? Iâ€™m a passionate Developer and Designer. Programming is what
            connects me with people and where I learn every day something new.

            It all started when I was around 12 years old when my teacher showed us Scratch.
            A platform where you can build simple games in block style. Since then I wanted more
